/*:
 Time dilation is often considered a two dimensional probelem, of space and time, but the second phenomena I'll cover today, *length contraction, is much easier to visualize using two space dimensions, so I will present a 3 dimensional scene.
 
 I'll explain as I go, so please hit "Run My Code"
 
 First you'll notice our friend the spacetime meter in his usual position, this time controlling both our 3D scene, and our spacial representation. The 3D scene contains our 2D rocket suspended in air, which is rotated towards its velocity. It casts a shadow onto the 2D ground, which is squished as the rocket approaches high speeds.
 
 This is length contraction. As objects approach high speeds, they become smaller when measured by a stationary observer. Of course, just like time, anyone aboard the rocket would never notice a change. 
 
 The rocket below shows the effects of length contraction as it moves faster.
